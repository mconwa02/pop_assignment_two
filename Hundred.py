Players take turns to roll a die as many times or until 1 is rolled.
Each number rolled, except a 1, is added to players score.
If 1 is rolled score for this turn is zero and turn ends.
At the end of each turn, the score for that turn is
added to the player's total score.
The first player to reach or exceed 100 wins.
